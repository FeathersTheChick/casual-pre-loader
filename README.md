# Download the latest release [Here](https://github.com/cueki/casual-particle-pre-loader/releases/).

Or if you want to run with python:

```
git clone https://github.com/cueki/casual-particle-pre-loader
cd casual-particle-pre-loader
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```
# Some Info:

### Simply put, <ins> any custom particle you want can now work in casual. </ins>

### Dx80 doesn't work (any particle with dx80 in its name) because they are special, this may be resolved in the future if enough people ask for it.

### IF YOU GET ANY WEIRD ERRORS LIKE "an error occured: 8" IT'S BECAUSE THE BACKUP IS CORRUPT, DELETE THE BACKUP FOLDER AND VERIFY GAME FILES, THEN TRY AGAIN :).

This, of course, may make your game unstable, the presets I provide will be tested by me and others vigorously to ensure as few crashes as possible.

If at any point the game is too unstable, and you cannot figure out why, I have included a "restore backup" feature that should return the game to its original state. **If this does not work for whatever reason, verify the game's integrity in Steam, and it will all go back to normal.**

As for performance, I only tested this locally with my own config and saw little to no difference between the presets (nothing outside the range of random distribution). Your result may vary with different configs/ settings.

Is this VAC safe? Yes. Could Valve patch this out of the game easily? Also yes. Enjoy it while you can :).

This is my love letter to TF2, thank you for 15 years.

# Steps For Making Your Own Preset:

# Thank you <3:
### Mod makers

[THE GOAT](https://gamebanana.com/members/2133251) This person made both the [minecraft_preset](https://gamebanana.com/mods/435309) and the [ghytd_preset](https://gamebanana.com/mods/451166). Very talented, has a good vision, and still updates his packs monthly. 

[Skeleton Hotel](https://gamebanana.com/members/1414545) This guy also has some crazy good effects, his short circuit being the first particle file working in this project. Will be combining his effects to make another preset soon.

[Taxicat](https://gamebanana.com/members/1333549) and [Qorange](https://gamebanana.com/members/2060075) for the [transparent_flamethrower](https://gamebanana.com/mods/348622) and x64 update, these were the first particle files I ever looked at, as well as the original intention of this idea.

[Ashe_tf](https://gamebanana.com/members/1932153) for fixing the [medicgun_beam](https://gamebanana.com/mods/437447) and its invisible nonsense.

[SonOfDiscordiA](https://gamebanana.com/members/2670597) for such a simple change to the [short_circuit](https://gamebanana.com/mods/446897), this taught me how the files worked internally. 

[agrastiOs](https://github.com/agrastiOs) for the [UltimateVisualFixPack](https://github.com/agrastiOs/Ultimate-TF2-Visual-Fix-Pack), this should just be in the game already.
