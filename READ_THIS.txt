Hi.
Thank you for installing my preloader. (Ver 1.6.+)
Simply double click RUNME
I recommend checking this file every update as there might be some extra info regarding upgrading from version to version.

FOR MOD MAKERS:
If you would like to produce mods that work alongside this tool, for both particles and model files, the easiest way to ensure compatibility is to copy the internal structure that is present in TF2. Don't use any custom folder names in your vmt $basetexture paths etc.

FOR PARTICLE MAKERS SPECIFICALLY:
Take a look at particle_system_map.json, YOUR ELEMENT NAMES MUST MATCH WHAT IS IN THAT FILE, WITH PROPER CASING. ExplosionCore_MidAir cannot be ExplosionCore_Midair, for example, and it needs to be in explosion.pcf, anywhere else and other effects will get deleted.

10/09/2025 (update 1.6.0):
ive been working on this silently in the background for a while, its a pretty big update, im sorry if it breaks anything :(

hopefully all the changes make sense :)
